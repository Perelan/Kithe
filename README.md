# codename: Kithe - take a plung into travling.
A travel application that were prototyped on Berg-Hansen's hackathon. Hence, the application itself is not fully developed.

# Description
A group of students from University of Oslo decided to attend a well-spoken hackathon hosted by Berg Hansen (travling agency). We were a group of five youngsters, hatching a simple travling concept. Our main goals were to have a really simple user interface, and therefore a stricted user experience. We wanted to display something that looks really simple on the outside, but not much on the inside - something like Google Search. 

We divided the team into two groups, web and android developers. This repository is just for the android development.
